## What are Embedded Systems?

An Embedded System is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function. Training computing systems called embedded systems are made to carry out specific tasks inside of bigger systems. These systems are integrated into appliances and gadgets to manage particular operations, frequently in real-time. 

## Do you know what IoT is?

The term Internet of Things, IoT, refers to a network of connected physical objects, often referred to as “things,” that use software, sensors, and a variety of technologies to gather and transmit information over the Internet. These gadgets can be anything from commonplace items like wearable technology and appliances for the home to advanced urban facilities and industrial machinery.
The primary goal of IoT is to facilitate communication between devices and centralized systems, ultimately resulting in improved efficiency, automation of processes, and enhanced decision-making.

## Impact of IoT on industries

With the introduction of an interconnected system of connected gadgets that collect and transmit data, the Internet of Things (IoT) has drastically changed a number of businesses and spurred increased productivity and creativity. The IoT simplifies supply chain procedures and enables predictive maintenance in the production sector. Smart medical devices and remote patient monitoring are revolutionizing patient care in the healthcare industry. Retail experiences more individualized customer interactions and better control of inventory. Improved network optimization and smart city connectivity are observed in telecommunications. IoT has a broad impact across many industries, streamlining processes and opening up new opportunities in the rapidly changing technology-driven business environment.

## Embedded IoT Concepts: A Practical Application

Developing a Smart Home Infrastructure:
In this hands-on project, students will use embedded Internet of Things concepts to create and put into effect a smart home system. To gather data in real-time, the project integrates sensors—such as temperature sensors, door/window sensors, and motion detectors—with microcontrollers. After that, students will use protocols such as MQTT to create a smooth connection between the sensors and a central hub. The data will be processed by the central hub, which is typically a Raspberry Pi or a comparable device, and it will regulate different smart home appliances like locks, lights, and thermostats. The project provides hands-on experience with hardware, software, and communication protocols in a real-world setting, encompassing the entire Internet of Things ecosystem from sensor data acquisition to cloud integration.

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Solutions:
Students in this project with a business focus will explore the creation of Industrial IoT (IIoT) solutions to improve the effectiveness of operations. Industrial-grade chips, or programmable logic controllers (PLCs), are used in conjunction with sensors and actuators in this project. The configuration of communication protocols such as OPC, UA, or Modbus will be done by students to ensure smooth interaction between industrial equipment. Predictive maintenance systems, data analytics for process optimization, and real-time equipment health monitoring are all part of the execution. Security protocols will be prioritized to protect vital industrial data. The project leads to the development of a workable and secure IIoT solution and offers a practical understanding of IIoT applications while addressing the specific needs and difficulties of industrial settings.
